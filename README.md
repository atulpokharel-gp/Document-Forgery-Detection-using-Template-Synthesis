Document Forgery Detection with TensorFlow and Hugging Face Model
Overview
This repository provides a simple yet powerful document forgery detection system using TensorFlow for image manipulation detection and a pre-trained model from Hugging Face. The model can be downloaded from here.

Requirements
Make sure to install the required Python libraries before running the code. You can use the following commands to install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras pillow pydot pydotplus
Save to grepper
Usage
Download the Model:

Download the forgery detection model from Hugging Face and save it in the same directory as the script.

Run the Script:

Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python forgery_detection.py
You will be prompted to enter the path to the image you want to analyze. Please provide the complete path, and the system will output the prediction for the given image.

Functions and Processes
convert_to_ela_image(path, quality)
This function converts an input image to an Error Level Analysis (ELA) image. ELA highlights the differences in compression levels, helping to identify manipulated regions in the image.

prepare_image(image_path)
Prepares the input image for the model by applying ELA transformation and resizing it to the specified dimensions.

Model Loading and Prediction
The script loads the pre-trained model and takes an image as input. It then processes the image, predicts whether it's genuine or forged, and outputs the result.

Note
Ensure that the image you provide for analysis is in RGB format. The system will output the predicted class, either "fake" or "real," based on the pre-trained model.

Feel free to experiment with different images and adapt the code as needed for your specific use case. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the provided documentation or reach out for assistance.
